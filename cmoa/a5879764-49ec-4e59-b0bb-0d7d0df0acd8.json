Galerie de France, Paris, France [2]; purchased by Department of Fine Arts, Carnegie Institute, Pittsburgh, PA, December 1952. \n\nNotes:\n[1]. The painting was no. 164 in \"The 1952 Pittsburgh International Exhibition of Contemporary Paintings\" held at Carnegie Institute, October-December 1952.\n[2]. Copy of a November 13, 1952 cable from the gallery, suggests that the owner of the painting at the time may not have been the artist or the gallery (see curatorial file.) The museum subsequently purchased the painting from the 1952 International through the gallery; payment was forwarded on December 22, 1952 and acknowledged on December 26, 1952.",
