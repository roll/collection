  "provenance_text": "Commissioned by Nathaniel Hayden, Hartford, CT; gift to Sidney Hayden, his son, Hartford, CT; gift to Augusta Hayden [1817-], Charleston, SC [1]; Mrs. Izard? [2]; Lily L. Harby, Charleston, SC; purchased by Herbert DuPuy [1856-1930], Pittsburgh, PA, March 3, 1916; gift to Department of Fine Arts, Carnegie Institute, Pittsburgh, PA, November 1927. \nNOTES: [1] According to Herbert DuPuy, Augusta Hayden's daughter buried this item on the grounds of the Villa Margherita in Charleston, SC to protect it during the Civil War. It was reportedly damaged by shell fire and repaired. [2] The notes indicate that this person's birth name was Otis, which means that this was one of the female children of Nina Augusta Hayden, daughter of Augusta Haden. Nina Augusta married Arthur P. Otis of Charleston, SC on November 26, 1874.They had 5 daughters: Amy, Nina Hayden, Lottie, Maria Wwelsman and Eulia. Family geneaology records do not indicate which daughter became Mrs. Izard, and therefore the daughter-in-law of Judge Izard of Charleston, as noted in the documentation. See \"Records of the Connecticut line of the Hayden family\" by Jabez Haskell Hayden and William Benjamin Hayden.",
