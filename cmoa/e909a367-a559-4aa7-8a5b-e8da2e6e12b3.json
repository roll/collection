  "provenance_text": "Benton Murdoch Spruance [1904-1967], Philadelphia, PA, probably until July 1948; Mrs. James H. Beal (born Rebecca Huebley Jones) [1898-1993], Pittsburgh, PA, probably July 5, 1948 until April 11, 1957 [1]; gift to Department of Fine Arts, Carnegie Institute, Pittsburgh, PA, April 1957.\n\nNotes:\n[1]. Mrs. Beal purchased one of these lithographs from the artist for $24 on July 5, 1948 and two additional ones for $24 each on September 12, 1948 (see curatorial file for notes by Mrs. Beal and for invoice and receipt of payment from the artist.) The Beals lent one of these lithographs (no. 33) to \"Exhibition of Lithographs by Benton Spruance\" held at Department of Fine Arts, Carnegie Institute, May - June 1949. Based on notes by Mrs. Beal (entry no. 39 on her handwritten list,) the one exhibited was likely the one acquired first. Apparently, the lithographs in the exhibition remained on indefinite loan at Carnegie Institute (see letter to Mrs. Beal, dated January 18, 1955.) They were accessioned later, on April 11, 1957.",
