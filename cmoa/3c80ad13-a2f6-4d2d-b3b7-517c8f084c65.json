  "provenance_text": "Hilaire-Germain-Edgar Degas [1834-1917], Paris, France, until August 31, 1886; purchased by Durand-Ruel, Paris, France, August 31,1886 [1]; likely Paul Durand-Ruel [1831-1922] private collection, Paris, France, July 11, 1888 [2], [3]. Possibly Charles Durand-Ruel [1905-1985], Paris, France [4]. Wildenstein & Company, Inc., New York, NY, by October 1968; purchased by Museum of Art, Carnegie Institute, Pittsburgh, PA, December 1968.\n \nNotes:\n[1]. No. 851 printed on sticker on back of the mount. See correspondence with Caroline Durand-Ruel Godfroy, dated December 1, regarding Durand-Ruel Paris stock no. 851, \"Courses\" (Paris stock books 1884-1887.) It was purchased from Degas on August 31, 1886 and remained on the company's books until July 11, 1888.\n[2]. See above referenced correspondence in Note [1]. \n[3]. The supplement to Lemoisne's \"Degas et son œuvre\" (1984, no. 111) gives an alternate provenance for this work after 1886. It identifies the work as no. 97, \"Races,\" in the sale of French paintings from Durand-Ruel on May 5-6, 1887 at Moore's Art Galleries, William P. Moore, auctioneer, New York, NY, from which it was bought by Charles Haviland, Paris. This provenance is also given by Wildenstein in correspondence with the museum at the time of the purchase of the work in 1968. However, the correspondence with Caroline Godfroy, as indicated in Note [1], places stock no. 851 in the company books until July 1888. So apparently, sale of this work at auction in May 1887 is, at least, questionable. \n[4]. See letter from Louis Goldenberg of Wildenstein & Co., dated December 3, 1968, in curatorial file.",
