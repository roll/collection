Purchased from the artist for $24 on April 15, 1949 (see curatorial file for invoice and receipt of payment from the artist.) The Beals lent the lithograph (no. 53) to \"Exhibition of Lithographs by Benton Spruance\" held at Department of Fine Arts, Carnegie Institute, May - June 1949. Apparently, the lithographs in the exhibition remained on indefinite loan at Carnegie Institute (see letter to Mrs. Beal, dated January 18, 1955.) They were accessioned later, on April 11, 1957.",
