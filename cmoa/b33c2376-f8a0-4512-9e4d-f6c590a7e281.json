  "provenance_text": "John Goodrich Henry, MD [1858-1941], Winchendon, MA, until January 18, 1941; his daughter Mrs. Ruth Hubbard, Keene, NH [1]; The Trade Shop, East Boothbay, ME, until August 1955 [2]; Mrs. James H. Beal (born Rebecca Huebley Jones) [1898-1993], Pittsburgh, PA, August 1955 until December 1955 [3]; gift to Department of Fine Arts, Carnegie Institute, Pittsburgh, PA, December 1955 [4].\n\nNotes:\n[1]. The Henry family provenance, provided to Mrs. Beal by Mrs. E. Prentiss Jones (see note [2],) is recorded in Mrs. Beal's notes and correspondence on the subject (see donor file.) It is unclear whether the plate was purchased by The Trade Shop from Dr. Henry's daughter as owner or as representative of her father's estate.) \n[2]. The antique shop in Maine was owned by E. Prentiss Jones and this wife, Harriet T. Jones. \n[3]. Mrs. Beal purchased several plates and a platter (55.37.2 to 55. 37.10) in August 1955 for an approximate valuation of $200 (see Mrs. Beal's letter to Gordon Washburn, dated August 10, 1955, in donor file.)\n[4]. The plate was shipped to Carnegie Institute in August 1955; it was accessioned on December 19, 1955.",
