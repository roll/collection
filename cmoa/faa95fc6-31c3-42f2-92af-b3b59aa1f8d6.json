Émile Louis Dominique Calando [1840-1898], Paris, France (Lugt 837) [1]; probably his sale, December 11-12, 1899, Hotel des Commissaires-Priseurs, Rue Druot, No. 9, Paris, France [2]; acquired by his son Émile Pierre Victor Calando [1872-1953], Paris and Grasse, France (Lugt 426b) [3].

Dr. and Mrs. Daniel Fishkoff, Colonia, NJ, by June 12, 1974 [5]; their gift to Museum of Art, Carnegie Institute, Pittsburgh, PA, December 1975.\n\nNotes:\n[1]. His collector's mark is stamped on the drawing (recto lower left.)\n[2]. The sale, entitled \"Dessins Anciens,\" included several Gillot drawings of mythological subjects of the size of the present drawing, which were not specifically identified.\n[3]. His collector's mark is stamped on the drawing (verso bottom.) His sale at Hotel Drouot, Paris, on March 17-18, 1927 apparently did not include this drawing.\n[4].

Several other works in the Fishkoff collection have also passed through the Seiferheld gallery in NYC, which was active throughout the 1960s under various names.\n[5].
