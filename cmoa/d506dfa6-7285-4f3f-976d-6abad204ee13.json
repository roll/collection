  "provenance_text": "Benton Murdoch Spruance [1904-1967], Philadelphia, PA, until July 1948; Mrs. James H. Beal (born Rebecca Huebley Jones) [1898-1993], Pittsburgh, PA, July 5, 1948 until April 11, 1957 [1]; gift to Department of Fine Arts, Carnegie Institute, Pittsburgh, PA, April 1957.\n\nNotes:\n[1]. Purchased from the artist for $18 (see entry no. 38 in Mrs. Beal's handwritten notes on Spruance lithographs in curatorial file.) The Beals lent the lithograph (no. 24) to \"Exhibition of Lithographs by Benton Spruance\" held at Department of Fine Arts, Carnegie Institute, May - June 1949. Apparently, the lithographs in the exhibition remained on indefinite loan at Carnegie Institute (see letter to Mrs. Beal, dated January 18, 1955.) They were gifted and accessioned later, on April 11, 1957. It should be noted that Mrs. Beal purchased a second lithograph of this subject from Frank K. M. Rehn, Inc., New York, NY in March 1949. This is likely 57.3.29, since most of the prints in the exhibition had been delivered to Carnegie Institute by March 1, 1949.",
