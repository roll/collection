  "provenance_text": "Carl W. Hamilton [1886-1967], New York, NY; Daniel M. Clemson [1853-1936], Pittsburgh, PA, until 1936 [1]; Estate of Daniel E. Clemson; gift to Department of Fine Arts, Carnegie Institute, Pittsburgh, PA, June 1937. \nNOTES: [1] Correspondence from the estate of Daniel M. Clemson on May 12, 1937 indicates that Clemson purchased this object from Carl W. Hamilton \"approximately 15 years ago\" which would mean Clemson acquired this object in approximately 1922.  However, an appraisal addressed to Carl W. Hamilton from Charles L Haskell dated February 12, 1931 indicates that Hamilton still owned the item in 1931. The beginning of Clemson's ownership is therefore uncertain.",
