  "provenance_text": "Sir Henry Raeburn [1756-1823]; the sitter, Janet Bolt Lamb [1746-1819]; by descent to her son David Lamb II [1787-1863], Charleston, SC, Glasgow, Scotland, Liverpool, England, until 1863; by descent to his daughter Mary Lamb [1815-1888], Hereford Square, Kensington, London, 1863 until 1888; by descent to her niece Mrs. Wade Hampton Perry (Florence Charlotte Cropp Davies Perry) [1860-1942], Charleston, SC, by 1898 [1]; Macbeth Galleries, New York, NY; John Levy Galleries, New York, NY; Howard Young Galleries, New York, NY, in March 1919; John Levy Galleries, New York, NY; W. L. Mellon (William Larimer Mellon) [1868-1949], Pittsburgh, PA [2]; likely by descent to his son Dr. Matthew T. Mellon [1897-1992], Pittsburgh, PA and Miami, FL, by November 1981; his gift to Museum of Art, Carnegie Institute, Pittsburgh, PA, February 1982.\n\nNotes:\n[1]. The early provenance is from Reginald Poland's article about this painting in \"Art in America\", volume 5, February 1917, p. 60.  Information from the Shetland Family History website gives the sitter's place of birth as Cruister, Bressay, SHI (Cruista, Shetland Isles in the article) and confirms and supplements the genealogy given in the article (see curatorial file).  Also, see curatorial file for information on a version of the painting that appeared at Brunk Auctions, Asheville, NC in November 2013 (bought in) and again in May 2014 (sold for $1500). The catalogue entry for the latter auction refers to the information included in the \"Art in America\" article referenced above as pertaining to that version and lists its provenance as by \"descent in the Rutledge Family\".\n[2]. The New York art market information and the W. L. Mellon provenance are from the Frick Library photoarchive. The painting was advertised in \"International Studio\", vol. 67, no. 265, March 1919.",
