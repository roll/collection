  "provenance_text": "Winslow Homer [1836-1910]. Gustav Reichard [ca. 1843-1917], New York NY, until January 5, 1917 [1]; estate of Gustav Reichard until April 17, 1917; Reichard sale, American Art Association, Plaza Hotel, New York, NY, April 16-17, 1917, lot 93 [2]; purchased by Department of Fine Arts, Carnegie Institute, Pittsburgh, PA, May 1917 [3].\n\nNotes:\n[1]. See the New York Times edition, January 6, 1917.\n[2]. The two-day sale, \"Highly Important Old and Modern Paintings of Sterling Artistic Distinction\", included works from the estates of David T. Watson, Gustav Reichard, and others.  This painting, illustrated in the catalogue, sold on April 17, 1917 for $1250. American Art News (Volume 15, No. 28, April 21, 1917) reported the buyer as Knoedler & Co, likely acting as agent (see note [2] below). \n[3]. The museum blue card for this work lists the source as \"American Art Association through M. Knoedler.\" This likely explains why the 1917 Knoedler stock and sales books (Getty Research Institute) do not record this work, but do record others bought by the Knoedler firm at this sale.",
