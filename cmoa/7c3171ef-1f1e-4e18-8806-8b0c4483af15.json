  "provenance_text": "Francis Cotes [1726-1770]; likely by descent in the Dering family to Sir Henry E. Dering, 10th Bt. [1866-1931], Surrenden Dering, Kent, England [1]; P. & D. Colnaghi and Co., London; M. Knoedler & Co., London and New York, NY, October 7, 1919 until May 31, 1920 [2]; sold to John Levy, New York, NY on May 31, 1920 [3]; Mrs. J. Willis Dalzell (Mary Beer Dalzell) [1844-1929], Pittsburgh, PA, June 3, 1921 until February 13, 1929 [4]; Mary B. Dalzell estate, February 1929; bequest to Department of Fine Arts, Carnegie Institute, Pittsburgh, PA, February 1929 [5].\n\nNotes:\n[1]. See Knoedler Archive, The Getty Research Institute, London stock book, 1919. The sitter, Deborah Winchester, married Sir Edward Dering, 6th Bt. in 1765 (his second wife). The painting likely descended through the Dering family to Sir Henry E. Dering. Theodore Allen Heinrich, Director of the Royal Ontario Museum, in June 1956 correspondence in the museum donor files, also mentions that the painting was in the collection of Sir Henry Dering, 10th Bt.\n[2]. Knoedler owned 1/2 share of the painting with Colnaghi. See Knoedler London stock no. 6587; Knoedler New York stock no. 14831.\n[3]. Sold by the London branch for Â£1900. The Knoedler London sales book gives the date of sale as May 31, 1920; John Levy was billed by the New York branch on October 25, 1920, crediting the sale to London, May 31, 1920. Yet a third date, July 12, 1920, is given in the sold column of the London stock book.\n[4]. See original invoice from John Levy to Mrs. Dalzell in curatorial file.\n[5]. The painting was collected from Mrs. Dalzell's residence on Ridge Avenue in Pittsburgh and brought to Carnegie Institute on February 19, 1929. It was accessioned on February 25, 1929.",
