  "provenance_text": "T. Barrett, Lees, England, in 1758; Horace Walpole [1717-1797], Strawberry Hill, London, England. Earl of Warwick, by June 1865 [1]; sold to E. C. Hodgkins, London, England; purchased by Herbert DuPuy [1856-1930], Pittsburgh, PA, March 21, 1916; gift to Department of Fine Arts, Carnegie Institute, Pittsburgh, PA, November 1927. \nNOTES: [1] In June of 1865, the Earl of Warwick lends this miniature to the South Kensington Museum exhibition of portrait minatures, where it appears as #1942 on page 175. This means it was in the hands of Francis Greville, 5th Earl Warwick, who died in 1924. However, a note in the DuPuy catalogues notes that the \"present Earl Warwick\"  was the one who sold the minature to E. C. Hodgkins. If we date this note to the time the DuPuy gift was transferred to the Department of Fine Arts, Carnegie Institute, 1927, the \"current Earl of Warwick\" would be referring to Leopold Greville, 6th Earl Warwick, who lived from 1882-1928.",
