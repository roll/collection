  "provenance_text": "Angel Ferrant Vázquez [1891-1961], Madrid, Spain, until December 1958 [1]; Leland Hazard [1893-1980], Pittsburgh, PA, December 1958 [2]; his wife, Mary C. Hazard (Mary Chorn Hazard) [1900-1983], Pittsburgh, PA, until December 2, 1982 [3]; her gift to Museum of Art, Carnegie Institute, Pittsburgh, PA, December 1982.\n\nNotes:\n[1]. A sculpture by Ferrant with this title was exhibited (no. 149) in \"The 1958 Pittsburgh Bicentennial International Exhibition of Contemporary Painting and Sculpture\" held at Carnegie Institute, December 1958 - February 1959. The dimensions of the sculpture given in the catalogue, though, are apparently in error. The exhibition entry form for the sculpture completed by the artist in September 1958, however, is consistent with the actual height of the work in the collection of Mr. and Mrs. Leland Hazard (see curatorial file and note [2] below.) \n[2]. The sculpture exhibited in the International was purchased by Mr. Hazard for $200 (his check dated December 22, 1958.)\n[3]. Mr. Hazard died on August 17, 1980. Mrs. Hazard offered the sculpture to the museum in August 1982. Contemporaneous note in curatorial file also indicates that this is the sculpture from the 1958 International.",
