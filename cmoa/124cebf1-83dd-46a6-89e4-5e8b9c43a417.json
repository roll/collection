  "provenance_text": "Guglielmo de Sanctis [1829-1911], Rome, Italy; Maria Elizabeth Cleveland [1822-1897], New York, NY and Paris, France, until at least 1884; Marvin F. Scaife, Pittsburgh, PA [1]. Mrs. Harry B. Richardson (Jean Holt Richardson) [1888-1960], Beaver, PA, by 1923 or 1924 [2]; by descent to her daughter Mrs. G. Philip Hamilton (Jean Richardson Hamilton) [1909-2001], Beaver, PA, by July 1997; her gift to Carnegie Museum of Art, Pittsburgh, PA, October 1997.\n \nNotes: \n[1]. See partial inscription on label removed from the reverse of the canvas. After a few relatively minor bequests to her sister and two servants, Mrs. Cleveland's will gave all of her furniture, objects of bijouterie and virtu to William Lucien Scaife; his brother Marvin F. Scaife was, however, the major beneficiary, receiving \"a life income of substantially all her property...\" See copy of \"Matter of the Contested Will of Maria Elizabeth Cleveland, Deceased\" (reference information of court decision and copies of newspaper reports in curatorial file.)\n[2]. Mrs. Richardson's daughter Mrs. Philip Hamilton, in conversation with Sally Davoren in July 1997, recalled that her mother bought the painting at a sale of property from a local storage company, perhaps Grogan's in Wilkinsburg, sometime in 1923 or 1924 (see notes from Sally Davoren in curatorial file.) The painting hung in the entryway of the family's Beaver home from the 1920's until summer 1997.",
