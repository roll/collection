The painting was no. 459 in the \"Eleventh Annual Exhibition\" held at Carnegie Institute, Pittsburgh, PA, April - June 1907. Mrs. Martha S. Twachtman (rather that the Twachtman estate) is listed in the catalogue as a lender to the exhibition.\n[2]. Carnegie Institute purchased the painting from the exhibition through Silas S. Dustin, agent for the John H. Twachtman estate. The purchase deal involved, in part, exchange of \"Greenwich Hills\" (a painting by the artist, which had been acquired in 1905.) The present painting was accessioned on November 19, 1907.",
