  "provenance_text": "Attributed to (circle of) Alessandro Allori [1535-1607], Florence, Italy. Unidentified collection, England, by the mid-19th century [1]. Collis P. Huntington [1821-1900], New York, NY, until August 13, 1900 [2]; bequest to Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, NY, with life interest to his widow, Arabella D. Huntington, [1851-1924], New York, NY, August 13, 1900 until September 16, 1924 [3]; by descent, life interest to Archer Milton Huntington [1870-1955], New York, NY, September 16, 1924 until at least April 30, 1925 [4]; Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, NY, by May 1, 1925 [5]; sold at American Art Galleries, New York, NY, November 20, 1925, no. 106 [6]. Arthur E. Braun [1876-1976], Pittsburgh, PA, until December 5, 1976; by descent to his daughter Mrs. Paul B. Ernst (Elizabeth Munhall Braun Ernst) [c. 1906-1987], Pittsburgh, PA, until May 11, 1978; gift to Museum of Art, Carnegie Institute, Pittsburgh, PA, May 1978 [7]. \n\nNotes:\n[1]. In England by the mid-19th century when restored by F. Leedham, who was active in London c.1830-1860. Possibly in the collection of Miss Rogers, London, England, by 1835 (see Waagen II, p. 269: \"Agnolo Bronzino. Portrait of Leonora di Toledo, wife of Cosimo I., Grand Duke of Tuscany; half the size of life. An admirable work, distinguished from most of the pictures by this master by the transparency and warmth of the flesh tones.\") Miss Rogers (Sarah Rogers [1772-1855]) inherited the collection of her brother Henry Rogers in 1833 or 1834; however, she was also a collector herself. In turn, she left the majority of her collection to another brother the poet Samuel Rogers [1763-1855] at her death in January 1855. After his death in December 1855, his collection was sold at auction in April-May 1856 and included the Bronzino portrait (no. 683.)\n[2]. It is not yet clear when and how the painting became part of the Huntington collection but it was in his possession by August 1900.\n[3]. Collis P. Huntington, in his will, gave his collection of pictures to the Metropolitan Museum of Art with life interest to Arabella Huntington, his second wife and his adopted son, Archer M. Huntington. Arabella married Henry E. Huntington [1850-1927], who was the nephew of Collis P. Huntington, in July 1913. She is referred to as \"Mrs. Henry E. Huntington\" in documents after the marriage. \n[4]. Although life interest in this work was transferred to Archer Huntington from Arabella Huntington after her death, he terminated his life interest in 1925 and gave the work, among others in the original bequest, to the Metropolitan Museum. Specifically, this portrait was no. 36 among the paintings delivered to the Metropolitan Museum of Art from the Collis P. Huntington estate on April 30 and May 1, 1925 (see curatorial file.)\n[5]. Metropolitan Museum accession number 25.110.131 (written in red paint on stretcher.)\n[6]. As by Antonio Allori (Bronzino); sold for $ 430 (see curatorial file for annotated copy of the sales catalogue.)\n[7]. Accessioned on May 11, 1978.",
