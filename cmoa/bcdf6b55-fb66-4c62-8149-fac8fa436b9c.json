Dalzell estate, February 1929; bequest to Department of Fine Arts, Carnegie Institute, Pittsburgh, PA, February 1929 [2].\n\nNotes:\n[1]. Sources differ regarding the artist's birth date, given in various years between 1854 and 1868. Though a note in the curatorial file indicates that the 1868 date was confirmed by the artist, the earliest date appears more consistent (see curatorial file.) \n[2]. The painting was collected from Mrs. Dalzell's residence on Ridge Avenue in Pittsburgh and brought to Carnegie Institute on February 19, 1929. It was accessioned on February 25, 1929.",
