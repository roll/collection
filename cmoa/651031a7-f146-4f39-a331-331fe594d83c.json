  "provenance_text": "Benton Murdoch Spruance [1904-1967], Philadelphia, PA; Mrs. James H. Beal (born Rebecca Huebley Jones) [1898-1993], Pittsburgh, PA, by April 1949 until April 11, 1957 [1]; gift to Department of Fine Arts, Carnegie Institute, Pittsburgh, PA, April 1957.\n\nNotes:\n[1]. Mrs. Beal purchased two of these lithographs from the artist for $35 each, in July 1947 and on April 15, 1949 (see curatorial file for receipts of payment from the artist.) The Beals lent one of these (no. 30) to \"Exhibition of Lithographs by Benton Spruance\" held at Department of Fine Arts, Carnegie Institute, May - June 1949.  It is not clear which of the two was exhibited, but likely it was this one. Apparently, the lithographs in the exhibition remained on indefinite loan at Carnegie Institute (see letter to Mrs. Beal, dated January 18, 1955.) They were accessioned later, on April 11, 1957. The second one of the lithographs was a gift to Carnegie institute of Technology in 1959.",
