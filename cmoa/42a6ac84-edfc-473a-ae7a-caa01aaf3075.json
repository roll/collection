  "provenance_text": "Thomas Gainsborough [1727-1788], Bath, England and London, England. Possibly P & D Colnaghi & Obach, London, England, January 1914 [1]. J. W. R. Crawford, New York, NY and New Rochelle, NY, until January 1917; M. Knoedler & Co., New York, NY, January 1917 until December 29, 1917 [2]; John Levy Galleries, New York, NY, December 29, 1917 until March 18, 1918 [3]; Mrs. J. Willis Dalzell (Mary Beer Dalzell) [1844-1929], Pittsburgh, PA, March 18, 1918 until February 13, 1929 [4]; Mary B. Dalzell estate, February 1929; bequest to Department of Fine Arts, Carnegie Institute, Pittsburgh, PA, February 1929 [5].\n \nNotes:\n[1]. Information from Knoedler Archive, Stock Book 6, The Getty Research Institute. See note [2] below.\n[2]. Knoedler stock no. 14070. The painting is listed as one of two works retruned by J. W. R. Crawford; below the title, the stock book entry includes the additional information: \"P & D Colnaghi & Obach Jan 1914 Â£ 1600.\" For comments on the work's provenance, see also correspondence with Ellis Waterhouse in curatorial file.\n[3]. John Levy Galleries no. 15875. Purchased from Knoedler for $14,000 (see Sales Book 11, Knoedler Archive, The Getty Research Institute.)  \n[4]. See copy of invoice from John Levy Galleries, dated March 18, 1918, in curatorial file. The price for the painting is given as $20,600. However, in subsequent correspondence with the gallery, dated April 8, 1919, which lists Mrs. Dalzell's purchases, the price for the painting is given as $19,400. This is likely an error in the application of a $600 credit given at the time of the original transaction.\n[5]. The painting was collected from Mrs. Dalzell's residence on Ridge Avenue in Pittsburgh and brought to Carnegie Institute on February 19, 1929. It was accessioned on February 25, 1929.",
