Beal (born Rebecca Huebley Jones) [1898-1993], Pittsburgh, PA, April 15, 1949 until April 11, 1957 [1]; gift to Department of Fine Arts, Carnegie Institute, Pittsburgh, PA, April 1957.\n\nNotes:\n[1]. Mrs. Beal purchased the lithograph from the artist for $15 on April 15, 1949 (see receipt of payment dated April 20, 1949.) The Beals lent the lithograph (no. 25) to \"Exhibition of Lithographs by Benton Spruance\" held at Department of Fine Arts, Carnegie Institute, May - June 1949. Apparently, the lithographs in the exhibition remained on indefinite loan at Carnegie Institute (see letter to Mrs. Beal, dated January 18, 1955.) They were accessioned later, on April 11, 1957.",
