Miss Eleanor Gillespie McCallam was a granddaughter of J. J. Gillespie, the Pittsburgh art gallery owner, so perhaps the painting descented through the Gillespie-McCallam family.\n[2]. Purchased for $75, apparently as a gift to Carnegie Institute (see curatorial file for Mrs. Beal's record of the work, dated March 8, 1954.)\n[3]. The painting was received at Carnegie Institute in February 1954. It was accessioned on March 3, 1954.",
