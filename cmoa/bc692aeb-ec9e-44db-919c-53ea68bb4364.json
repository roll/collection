  "provenance_text": "Benton Murdoch Spruance [1904-1967], Philadelphia, PA; Mrs. James H. Beal (born Rebecca Huebley Jones) [1898-1993], Pittsburgh, PA, ca. 1947, but by May 1949 until April 11, 1957 [1]; gift to Department of Fine Arts, Carnegie Institute, Pittsburgh, PA, April 1957.\n\nNotes:\n[1]. Mrs. Beal purchased the lithograph from the artist ca. 1947 for $20 (see entry no. 35 in Mrs. Beal's handwritten list of early purchases of Spruance lithographs.) The Beals lent the lithograph (no. 8) to \"Exhibition of Lithographs by Benton Spruance\" held at Department of Fine Arts, Carnegie Institute, May - June 1949. Apparently, the lithographs in the exhibition remained on indefinite loan at Carnegie Institute (see letter to Mrs. Beal, dated January 18, 1955.) They were accessioned later, on April 11, 1957.",
