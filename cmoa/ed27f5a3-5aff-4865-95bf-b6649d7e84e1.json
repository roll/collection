  "provenance_text": "John Kane [1860-1934], Pittsburgh, PA. Valentine Gallery, New York, NY, by 1937; Sidney Janis Gallery, New York, NY, until 1966 [1]; Leon A. Arkus [1915-1999], Pittsburgh, PA; M. Knoedler and Co., New York, NY, as agent [2]; M. Knoedler and Co., New York, NY, April 15, 1968 to August 1, 1969 [3]; Thomas Mellon Evans [1910-1997], Greenwich, CT and New York, NY, until February 1973 [4]; gift to Museum of Art, Carnegie Institute, Pittsburgh, PA, February 1973 [5].\n\nNotes:\n[1]. Both the Valentine Gallery and the Sidney Janis Gallery lent the painting to various exhibitions during this period, partly evidenced by labels still present on the painting's verso. The Valentine Gallery is listed as the lender in MoMA's exhibition \"Masters of Popular Painting: Modern Primitives of Europe and America,\" April-July, 1938.\n[2]. The painting, Knoedler stock no. CA-7615, entered on August 31, 1967, was on consignment from Mr. Arkus. The painting's dimensions in the Knoedler records are in error.\n[3]. The painting was taken into stock by Knoedler, New York on April 15, 1968 as stock no. A-9267 at a cost of $12,500.\n[4]. Mr. Evans was billed for the painting ($22,500) on August 1, 1969. See copies of relevant information in curatorial file for notes [2], [3], and [4], obtained from the Knoedler Gallery Archive, The Getty Research Institute.\n[5]. The painting, a 1972 year-end gift, was accessioned on February 7, 1973.",
