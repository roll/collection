According to this reference, Gaston Bernheim de Villers purchased the painting for 960 F. He lent the painting to \"Exposition E. Vuillard\" held in May-July 1938 at the Musée des arts décoratifs.

Knoedler's painting stock book 10, The Getty Research Institute, lists Knoedler's source as Bernheim Jeune.\n[3]. Knoedler stock no. A-6107, as \"L'Esterel vue de Cannes.\" See [2] above.\n[4]. Purchased from Knoedler in December 1960 for $8,000 (see copy of relevant sales entry in Knoedler archive, The Getty Research Institute.)\n[5]. See correspondence with the The Art Institute of Chicago in curatorial file.  \n[6].
