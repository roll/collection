  "provenance_text": "Benton Murdoch Spruance [1904-1967], Philadelphia, PA, until September 1948; Mrs. James H. Beal (born Rebecca Huebley Jones) [1898-1993], Pittsburgh, PA, September 12, 1948 until April 11, 1957 [1]; gift to Department of Fine Arts, Carnegie Institute, Pittsburgh, PA, April 1957.\n\nNotes:\n[1]. Mrs. Beal purchased two of these lithographs from the artist for $24 each on September 12, 1948 (see curatorial file for invoice and receipt of payment from the artist.) The Beals lent one of these lithographs (no. 27) to \"Exhibition of Lithographs by Benton Spruance\" held at Department of Fine Arts, Carnegie Institute, May - June 1949. Apparently, the lithographs in the exhibition remained on indefinite loan at Carnegie Institute (see letter to Mrs. Beal, dated January 18, 1955.) They were accessioned later, on April 11, 1957.",
