Sold at H. Blairman & Sons, Ltd., London, by June 2007; purchased by Museum, 2007. \nNOTES:1. Morris had this cabinet made for his home, Allerton Priory, in Lancashire, England.  2. Liberty's  purchased most of Morris' Asian art collection. Further research into Christies and Liberty's archives could reveal the subsequent provenance.",
