  "provenance_text": "Gustav Klimt [1862-1918], Vienna, Austria; Gustav Nebehay [1881-1935], Vienna, Austria [1]; Joseph Urban [1872-1933], Yonkers, NY and New York, NY, by June 1922 until July 10, 1933 [2]; private collection, New York, NY, 1959 [3]; Galerie St. Etienne, New York, NY [4]; purchased by Department of Fine Arts, Carnegie Institute, Pittsburgh, PA, February 1960.\n\nNotes:\n[1]. From Fritz Novotny and Johannes Dobai, \"Gustav Klimt,\" Verlag Galerie Weltz, Salzburg, 1967, no. 164, p. 347, illustrated.\n[2]. Carl (Karl) Maria Georg Joseph (Josef) Urban, born in Vienna, Austria, was a noted stage and film designer and architect, who immigrated to the United States in 1912. See letter from Neue Galerie, New York, dated June 13, 2016, regarding Urban's ownership of the painting and its exhibition at the opening of Wiener Werkst√§tte of America, Inc. in June1922.\n[3]. Mrs. Joseph Urban (Mary Porter Beegle Urban.) Mrs. Urban is listed as a lender to the 1959 Klimt exhibition at Galerie St. Etienne in New York City, where the painting was included and illustrated in the catalogue. Information from Jane Kallir and Hildegard Bachert of Galerie St. Etienne (specifically e-mails reporting on conversations with them, dated May-June 2003) confirms the descent of the painting in the Urban family, specifically his widow, who sold it to the gallery after the 1959 Klimt exhibition there.\n[4]. Galerie St. Etienne (Otto Kallir) sent the painting to the museum on approval sometime in late 1959, likely in December 1959. The museum agreed to terms for the purchase of the painting in January 1960 and accessioned it the following month.",
