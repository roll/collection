See curatorial file for information on the Hampden and Hope families.  \n[2]. Listed as as \"The Property of the Trustees of the Late Henry W. Hope, Esq.\" in the sale entitled \"Early British Portraits and Pictures by Old Masters\".  The catalogue entry indicates that the work was illustrated, but no illustration was included in the Frick Reference Library copy.  \n[3]. Purchased for £3780, from the annotated auction catalogue at the Frick Reference Library. The Knoedler London and New York stock books indicate that P. & D. Colnaghi & Co, London purchased the picture from (or after?) this auction for £3675; it is possible that \"Blair\" represented Colnaghi or that the picture was first bought-in; see also note [4] below. \n[4]. Knoedler London No. 6565 and Knoedler New York No. 14937 in joint account with Colnaghi (1/2 share). \n[5]. Sometimes referred to as R. B. Mellon or by his full name, Richard Beatty Mellon. He purchased the picture at Knoedler London for £18000. The information for the Colnaghi-Knoedler relationship in this painting comes from the Knoedler Archives, The Getty Research Institute.\n[6]. Sarah Mellon Scaife retained life interest in this work until December 1965. The Museum formally received the painting from the estate in November 1966.",
