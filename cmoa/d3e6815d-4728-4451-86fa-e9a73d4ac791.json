Purchased by Lady Darwin, August 28, 1917; Herbert Dupuy, Pittsburgh, PA [1]; gift to Department of Fine Arts, Carnegie Institute, Pittsburgh, PA, November 1927. \nNOTES: [1] DuPuy notes that this item was purchased \"by Lady Darwin\" from the Salter, Simpson & Sons sale on August 28, 1917. However, it is not clear in what capacity Lady Darwin was acting, i.e. as DuPuy's agent, or as a collector in her own right. This is likely Lady Florence Henrietta Darwin, also known as Florence Henrietta Fisher and Florence Henrietta Maitland.",
