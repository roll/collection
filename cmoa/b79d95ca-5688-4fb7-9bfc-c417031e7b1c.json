  "provenance_text": "Benton Murdoch Spruance [1904-1967], Philadelphia, PA; Mrs. James H. Beal (born Rebecca Huebley Jones) [1898-1993], Pittsburgh, PA, by April 1949 until April 11, 1957 [1]; gift to Department of Fine Arts, Carnegie Institute, Pittsburgh, PA, April 1957.\n\nNotes:\n[1]. Mrs. Beal purchased a lithograph with this title from the artist for $35 on April 15, 1949 (see receipt of payment from the artist, dated April 20, 1949.) The Beals lent a lithograph with this title (no. 19) to \"Exhibition of Lithographs by Benton Spruance\" held at Department of Fine Arts, Carnegie Institute, May - June 1949. The catalogue gives the date of the work as 1947. The Beals owned at least two prints of this work (see correspondence dated March 6, 1966 in curatorial file.) It is not clear which of the two was exhibited, but likely it was this one. Apparently, the lithographs in the exhibition remained on indefinite loan at Carnegie Institute (see letter to Mrs. Beal, dated January 18, 1955.) They were accessioned later, on April 11, 1957.",
