Knoedler, London provenance from \"American Paintings and Sculpture to 1945 in the Carnegie Museum of Art,\" pages 285-286. However, the painting is apparently not in the 1936 stock books of the London branch of the company. Perhaps Knoedler acted as agent.\n[2]. On consignment from Mr. Beaton, Knoedler stock no. CA 6114.\n[3]. The painting was taken into stock by Knoedler, New York on May 3, 1963 as stock no. A8507 at a cost of $2,500.\n[4]. Mr. Winokur was billed for the painting ($7,800) in July 1964, though the purchase was dated March 23, 1964. See copies of relevant information in curatorial file for notes [2], [3], and [4], obtained from the Knoedler Gallery Archive, The Getty Research Institute.",
