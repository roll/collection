Beal to Carnegie Museum of Art, Pittsburgh, PA, February 1994.\n\nNotes:\n[1]. Pescin estate stamp is present on the drawing (lower right.) Note that this stamp differs from the \"Atelier Parcin\" stamp (most often in blue and rectangular in shape) and should be further investgated.\n[2]. \"Collection of Robert Laurent\" is typed on the drawing's original label from Kraushaar Galleries (in curatorial file.) This is likely the sculptor Robert Laurent [1890-1970].\n[3]. Mrs. Beal purchased the drawing, as \"Two Girls,\" for $250 on January 6, 1956. Receipt of final payment from Kraushaar Galleries is dated May 17, 1956 (see copy in curatorial file.)",
