  "provenance_text": "John B. Flannagan [1895-1942]; likely Buchholz Gallery, New York, NY [1]; Edgar J. Kaufmann [1885-1955], Pittsburgh, PA, by June 1941 [2]. G. David Thompson [1899-1965], Pittsburgh, PA, by October 1963 until likely June 26, 1965 [3]; his wife, Helene S.

See reference to the Buchholz Gallery and its head, Curt Valentin, in note [2] below.  \n[2]. The artist began a letter to Edgar Kaufmann as follows: \"Im glad to hear from Curt Valentin; my carved rock \"Little Creature\" has passed into your Im sure good hands. (sic)\" See original letter from the artist to Edgar Kaufmann in curatorial file. The letter was forward to Mr. Kaufmann by the Buchholz Gallery on June 17, 1941.

Mr. Thompson lent the sculpture to the Flannagan exhibition at the University of Notre Dame's Art Gallery in 1963; the exhibition opened on October 6, 1963. \n[4].
