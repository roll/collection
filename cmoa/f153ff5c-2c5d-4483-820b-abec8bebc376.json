Robert Hartshorne [1866-1927], New York, NY and Highlands, NJ (L. 2215b) until January 13, 1927; by descent in the Hartshorne family to most recent owner in October 2007 [1]; sold at Christie's, New York, NY, October 30, 2007, no. 12 [2]; purchased by Carnegie Museum of Art, Pittsburgh, PA, October 2007.\n\nNotes:\n[1]. The Robert Hartshorne Cassatt collection passed first to his wife, Margaret Willis Hartshorne (1868-1942), who maintained it intact during her lifetime; upon her death, it descented  to their son, Richard Hartshorne (1900-1958), who sold parts of it at auction (many works on paper, including 54 by Cassatt, were sold at Parke-Bernet Galleries in New York, NY in January 1946); Richard Hartshorne left his estate to his wife, Hellene Gardenier Hartshorne (1903-1997), who retained the remaining Cassatt works; on her death they were inherited by a niece, a grand-daughter of the original collector.
