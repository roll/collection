  "provenance_text": "Henry Moore [1898-1986] [1]; M. Knoedler & Co., Inc., New York, NY [2]; gift to Department of Fine Arts, Carnegie Institute, Pittsburgh, PA, March 1959 [3].\n\nNotes:\n[1]. The sculpture was exhibited in \"The 1958 Pittsburgh Bicentennial International Exhibition of Contemporary Painting and Sculpture\" (no. 302, illustrated in catalogue, plate 102) held at Carnegie Institute, December 1958 - February 1959.\n[2]. Knoedler CA 5743; entry in Knoedler's commission book 5b, made in June 1959, lists the artist as the sculpture's owner and G. David Thompson as the buyer (GRI.) \n[3]. The sculpture was a gift of Mr. and Mrs. G. David Thompson, Pittsburgh, PA, in memory of Mr. Thompson's son David. In contracting to buy the sculpture for Carnegie Institute, Mr. Thompson dealt directly with Knoedler's (see information in note [2] above.) It appears that the sale had not yet been completed as of June 1, 1959 (see curatorial file for relevant information.)",
