Beal, Pittsburgh, PA, December 22, 1966 until February 14, 1987 [2]; Mrs. James H. Beal (born Rebecca Huebley Jones), Pittsburgh, PA, until April 23, 1993; bequest of Mr. and Mrs. James H. Beal to Carnegie Museum of Art, Pittsburgh, PA, February 1994.\n\nNotes:\n[1]. The early provenance is taken from hand-written information on the back of a photo of the sculpture by John D. Schiff, New York, NY, the source of which is apparently the Zabriskie Gallery. A note by Mrs. Beal in the curatorial file repeats the same provenance prior to Zabriskie Gallery. \n[2]. The sculpture was purchased from the Zabriskie Gallery for $2800 (see curatorial file for purchase information from the Beal files.)",
