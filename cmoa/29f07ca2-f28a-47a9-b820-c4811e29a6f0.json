  "provenance_text": "Eugène Fromentin [1820-1876]. M. Lagarde, Paris, France, by June 1892 until before January 27, 1897[1]; M. Knoedler & Co., New York, NY by May 1897 [2]; sold to Alexander MacBurney Byers [1827-1900], Pittsburgh, PA, May 15, 1897 until September 19, 1900 [3]; Alexander M. Byers estate, 1900-1935; J. Frederic Byers [1881-1949], Sewickley Heights, PA, 1935 until June 11, 1949 [4]; by descent to Mrs. J. Frederic Byers, Sewickley Height, PA, until December 1955 [5]; her gift to Department of Fine Arts, Carnegie Institute, Pittsburgh, PA, December 1955.\n\n[1]. M. Lagarde lent the painting to the exhibition \"Cent chefs-d'oeuvre\" at the Galerie Georges Petit in Paris in June 1892; it was no. 104 in the exhibition catalogue.  It was no. 78 in the special oversize publication of works from the exhibition, where it was also illustrated on p. 130.  The Knoedler archive (see note [3] below) provides further information on this owner; the entry for this painting reads: \"Bought by us directly from W. Lagarde Broker.  Lent by him for the Exhibition of the Cent chefs d'oeuvre 1892.\"   The reference to \"Broker\" is confirmed in an annotated copy of the posthumous sale of works from Lagarde's collection on January 27, 1897 at Galerie Georges Petit (John G. Johnson Collection Library), which describes him as \"ancien Agent de Change.\" \n[2]. See Knoedler Gallery Archive, sales books (no. 7), The Getty Research Institute.\n[3]. Sold to A. M. Byers for $12000. Mr. Byers lived in Allegheny, now part of Pittsburgh, PA.\n[4]. See curatorial file for copies of relevant information from the Byers Family Art Collection Inventories, Frick Art Reference Library Archives.\n[5]. Jeannine Decroix Schley Byers was J. Frederic Byers' second wife, whom he married in December 1937.",
