  "provenance_text": "Gerald Leslie Brockhurst [1890-1978], London, England and New York, NY [1]; Mr. [1900-1958] and Mrs. [1903-1965] Alan M. Scaife, Pittsburgh, PA and Penguin Court, Ligonier, PA, January 1940 until July 1958 [2]; Mrs. Alan (Sarah Mellon) M. Scaife [1903-1965], Pittsburgh, PA and Penguin Court, Ligonier, PA, July 24, 1958 until December 28, 1965; her son, Richard M. Scaife [1932-2014], Pittsburgh, PA until September 1966; gift to Museum of Art, Carnegie Institute, Pittsburgh, PA, September 1966. \n\nNotes:\n[1]. The portrait was listed in Knoedler's sales book no. 14 on December 30, 1939 as one of several portrait commissions from Brockhurst, this one at a price of $6, 000 (see curatorial file for copy of relevant infromation from the Knoedler Archive, The Getty Research Institute.) \n[2]. Mr. and Mrs. Alan M. Scaife lent the painting to the Brockhurst exhibition at the Department of Fine Arts, Carnegie Institute, in February 1940 (no. 18, \"Portrait of Mrs. Alan M. Scaife.\") Correspondence in curatorial file indicates that the portrait was begun in January 1940 and that it was exhibited in a somewhat unfinished state (especially the background, as documented in a photograph of the portrait as exhibited in February 1940.) After the exhibition, in March 1940, it was returned to Knoedler's in New York and delivered to Mr. Brockhurst for the finishing touches.",
