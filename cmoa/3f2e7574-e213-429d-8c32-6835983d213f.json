  "provenance_text": "Benton Murdoch Spruance [1904-1967], Philadelphia, PA; Frank K. M. Rehn, Inc., New York, NY, until February 1948; Mrs. James H. Beal (born Rebecca Huebley Jones) [1898-1993], Pittsburgh, PA, February 1948 until April 11, 1957 [1]; gift to Department of Fine Arts, Carnegie Institute, Pittsburgh, PA, April 1957.\n\nNotes:\n[1]. Mrs. Beal purchased a Spruance lithograph with this title from the Rehn gallery for $24 in February 1948. The invoice from the gallery is dated February 6, 1948. Payment to the gallery was sent on February 16, 1948 (see curatorial file for copy of invoice and correspondence from Mrs. Beal from the Rehn archives at Archives of American Art.) The Beals lent the lithograph (no. 36) to \"Exhibition of Lithographs by Benton Spruance\" held at Department of Fine Arts, Carnegie Institute, May - June 1949. Apparently, the lithographs in the exhibition remained on indefinite loan at Carnegie Institute (see letter to Mrs. Beal, dated January 18, 1955.) They were accessioned later, on April 11, 1957.",
