  "provenance_text": "Benton Murdoch Spruance [1904-1967], Philadelphia, PA, until July 1947; Mrs. James H. Beal (born Rebecca Huebley Jones) [1898-1993], Pittsburgh, PA, July 1947 until April 11, 1957 [1]; gift to Department of Fine Arts, Carnegie Institute, Pittsburgh, PA, April 1957.\n\nNotes:\n[1]. Purchased from the artist for $15 in July 1947 (see receipt of payment from the artist.) The Beals lent the lithograph (no. 60) to \"Exhibition of Lithographs by Benton Spruance\" held at Department of Fine Arts, Carnegie Institute, May - June 1949. Apparently, the lithographs in the exhibition remained on indefinite loan at Carnegie Institute (see letter to Mrs. Beal, dated January 18, 1955.) They were accessioned later, on April 11, 1957.",
