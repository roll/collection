  "provenance_text": "Mary Cassatt [1844-1926]. Robert Hartshorne [1866-1927], New York, NY and Highlands, NJ (L.2215b), until January 13, 1927; by descent in the Hartshorne family [1], [2], [3]; Callamari Fine Art, New York NY, by August 3, 2009; purchased by Carnegie Museum of Art, Pittsburgh, PA, October 2009.\n\nNotes:\n[1]. The Robert Hartshorne Cassatt collection passed first to his wife, Margaret Willis Hartshorne (1868-1942), who maintained it intact during her lifetime; upon her death, it descented  to their son, Richard Hartshorne (1900-1958), who sold parts of it at auction (many works on paper, including 54 by Cassatt, were sold at Parke-Bernet Galleries in New York, NY in January 1946); Richard Hartshorne left his estate to his wife, Hellene Gardenier Hartshorne (1903-1997), who retained the remaining Cassatt works; on her death they were inherited by a niece, a grand-daughter of the original collector. See \"Hartshorne Family Papers, 1670-2014, A Descriptive Guide\" by Joseph W. Hammond, Monmouth County Historical Association, 2015, which gives biographical information and details of the descent of the collection though the family, particularly pages 177-178.\n[2]. There is unconfirmed information that the work was possibly at some point in the Havemeyer Collection, New York, NY.\n[3]. Ellen Calamari of Calamari Fine Art, New York, NY, contacted the museum in July 2009 as the representative of the descendants of Robert Hartshorne and offered a selection of works from the collection still available. This work was selected; it was shipped to the museum for approval on August 3, 2009 (see curatorial file.)",
