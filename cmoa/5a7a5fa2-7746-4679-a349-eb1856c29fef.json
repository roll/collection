  "provenance_text": "Jacob Ochtervelt [1634-1682]. Kleinberger, Paris, 1912 [1]. Baron Max von Goldschmidt-Rothschild [1843-1940], Frankfurt am Main, by 1925 until 1938? [2]. Rosenberg & Stiebel, New York, NY [3]; purchased by Department of Fine Arts, Carnegie Institute, Pittsburgh, PA, January 1954. \n\nNotes:\n[1]. See Susan Donahue Kuretsky \"The Paintings of Jacob Ochtervelt\", Phaidon Press, 1979, no.78. \n[2]. The Baron lent the painting to the exhibition \"Ausstellung von Meisterwerken alter Malerie aus Privatbesitz\" in Frankfurt in the summer of 1925. The painting was possibly included in the forced sale of the Baron's art collection to the city of Frankfurt am Main in November 1938. The  legality of this sale was challenged by the Baron's heirs after WWII; as a result, the sale was legally voided and the collection returned to the heirs in 1949. \n[3]. Likely obtained from the the estate/heirs of Max von Goldschmidt-Rothschild. Rosenberg & Stiebel had a very close relationship with members of the Goldschmidt-Rothschild family during this period; see correspondence with Gerald G. Stiebel of the gallery in the curatorial file.",
