Rosenbloom [1898-1973], Pittsburgh, PA (Lugt Suppl. 633b), by March 1938 until April 1, 1973 [2]; his bequest to Museum of Art, Carnegie Institute, Pittsburgh, PA, February 1974.\n\nNotes:\n[1]. The Frank Rehn Galleries lent the watercolor, as \"Rock Creek,\" to the Carnegie Institute and the Fogg Art Museum for exhibitions in 1933-1934. See curatorial file for original labels.\n[2]. The watercolor, one of two lent  by Mr. Rosenbloom, was  no. 13 in Carnegie Institute's \"An Exhibition of Water Colors and Oils by Charles Burchfield,\" held in March-April 1938. See curatorial file for copy of correspondence from the artist to his wife regarding this work (undated letter, c. 1930s, quoted in University of Buffalo thesis by Alana Ryder, 2012.) It refers to a man \"..the first one in Pittsburg\" to buy Burchfield works (he purchased two of the \"very best\"). This man is likely Charles Rosenbloom.",
