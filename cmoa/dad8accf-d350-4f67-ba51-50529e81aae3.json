  "provenance_text": "Benton Murdoch Spruance [1904-1967], Philadelphia, PA; Mrs. James H. Beal (born Rebecca Huebley Jones) [1898-1993], Pittsburgh, PA, likely in July 1947 but by May 1949 until April 11, 1957 [1]; gift to Department of Fine Arts, Carnegie Institute, Pittsburgh, PA, April 1957.\n\nNotes:\n[1]. Mrs. Beal purchased two copies of this lithograph from the artist for $15 each, in July 1947 and in April 1949. The Beals lent one of these (no. 16) to \"Exhibition of Lithographs by Benton Spruance\" held at Department of Fine Arts, Carnegie Institute, May - June 1949. It was likely the present print, from an edition of 30. The Beals' other print from an edition of 25 (see curatorial file,) was possibly the one given to Carnegie Institute of Technology in January 1959.",
