  "provenance_text": "Jeremiah Barrett [before1723-1770], Dublin, Ireland. G. David Thompson [1899-1965], Pittsburgh, PA, by 1954 until June 26, 1965 [1]; his wife, Helene S. Thompson (Mrs. G. David Thompson) [?-1982], Pittsburgh, PA, June 26, 1965 until May 1980; gift to Museum of Art, Carnegie Institute, Pittsburgh, PA, May 1980.\n\nNotes:\n[1]. The painting had been on loan to Carnegie Institute from Mr. Thompson from 1954 to 1957. In 1957, Mr. Thompson designated it as a gift to the museum but later that year changed the status back to a long-term loan with the intention to give it later. At his death in June 1965, the matter was unresolved. The painting remained at the museum officially as a loan until Mrs. Thompson gifted it in 1980 (from minutes of the Museum of Art, Carnegie Institute Committee Meeting, May 8, 1980.)\n\nUpdated and under review by CGK.",
