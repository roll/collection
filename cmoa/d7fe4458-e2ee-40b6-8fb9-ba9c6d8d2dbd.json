  "provenance_text": "Giovanni Domenico Tiepolo [1727-1804]. Possibly Duke of Salamanca, Spain [1]. Tomas Harris, Ltd., London, by June 1932 until at least 1938 [2]; Howard A. Noble [1874-1964], Pittsburgh, PA by November 1939 until April 30, 1964 [3] [4]; his bequest to Museum of Art, Carnegie Institute, Pittsburgh, PA, May 1964.\n\nNotes:\n[1]. This and another female portrait by Tiepolo are said to have been previously in the collection of the Duke of Salamanca, Spain (see copy of catalogue for the 1938 Tiepolo exhibition at the Art Institute of Chicago in curatorial file.)\n[2]. It is not clear whether Mr. Harris owned the paining personally or whether it was owned by one of his firms. It was included in exhibitions at Tomas Harris, Ltd., London in June-July 1932 (no. 12) and later, in August 1934 and June 1936, at the Spanish Art Gallery, London (a Harris family firm.) In the 1938 Tiepolo exhibition in Chicago, the lender is identified as Mr. Tomas Harris.\n[3]. Mr. Noble lent a Bachrach photograph of the painting to the Frick Art Reference Library in November 1939 for documentation in the FARL Photoarchive (FARL 32945.) \n[4]. A 1944 listing of the Noble collection in museum archives lists the painting as hanging in the dining room of the Noble residence at 1245 Shady Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA.",
