Goupil stockbook no. 4481 as \"La fanneuse\" (sic); purchased for 3,000F (see curatorial file for copy of relevant information from Goupil book 4 in the Goupil archive at The Getty Research Institute.)  \n[2]. Agreement to sell was made in September 1869; sold by Goupil for 7,500F. See above referenced record in Goupil book; see also \"William Bouguereau - Catalogue Raisonné of his Painted Work\" by Damien Bartoli, with Frederick C. Ross, Antique Collectors' Club, 2010 and 2014, no. 1869/10, plate 92, as well as correspondence from DeCourcy E. McIntosh, formerly of The Frick Art & Historical Center, in curatorial file. Note that lot 113 sold for £2,000 at Christie's in London on October 29, 1976 (a sale included in error in the provenance of the CMOA painting in the Bartoli publication), is not the CMOA painting but perhaps an early copy by Gustave Doyen (see curatorial file.)\n[3]. See December 4, 2012 and May 7, 2013 correspondence with Henry Hoffstot, Jr. in curatorial file.\n[4]. The painting hung over the fireplace in the library of their Pittsburgh residence, according to the correspondence with Henry Hoffstot, Jr. in note [3].\n[5]. Marguerite Martin Hoffstot.\n[6]. Mrs. Alan Nelson Jenkins.\n[7]. The painting was received by the museum from the estate on September 30, 1997; it was accessioned on October 2, 1997.",
