Audubon [1785-1851], 1819; Benjamin Page [1765-1834] [1]; Elizabeth Bakewell, his daughter [1797-1879] [2]; by descent to Anna Lea Bakewell [1848-], New Haven, CT [3]; Benjamin Page, Jr., Pittsburgh, PA, by 1931 [4]; Benjamin Page, Bridgehampton, New York, by February 1977 [5]; gift to Museum of Art, Carnegie Institute, Pittsburgh, PA, February 1977. \nNOTES: [1] Family lore has it that this portrait was drawn by Audubon on Benjamin Page's 50th birthday, after he asked Page's daughter, Elizabeth, if she would like him to draw her father's portrait. Elizabeth Bakewell was also Audubon's sister-in-law. See the publication of the Audubon Society of the Sewickley Valley's publication, The Cardinal, Vol. 1, issue 4, pg.17. [2] Elizabeth Bakewell, ne√© Elizabeth Rankin Page, married Thomas Woodhouse Bakewell, Audubon's brother-in-law, in July of 1816 [3] Anna Lea Bakewell was the granddaughter of Elizabeth Bakewell. [4] See The Cardinal, Vol. III, No. 1, January 1931, pg. 203. [5] This is the great-great-grandson of the sitter.",
