  "provenance_text": "Meindert Hobbema [1638-1709], Amsterdam, Netherlands. Rhoades collection. Possibly John Levy Galleries, New York, NY [1]; Mrs. J. Willis Dalzell (Mary Beer Dalzell) [1844-1929], Pittsburgh, PA, until February 13, 1929; Mary B. Dalzell estate, February 1929; bequest to Department of Fine Arts, Carnegie Institute, Pittsburgh, PA, February 1929 [2].\n\nNotes:\n[1]. A typed note from an unknown source in the curatorial file gives what appears to be an inventory number for the painting (#20572) and indicates its provenance in the Rhoades collection. The inventory number is consistent with that used by the John Levy Galleries, from which Mrs. Dalzell purchased many of the paintings in her collection. If this is the case, it would place the painting at that gallery sometime in the mid-1920s.\n[2]. The painting was collected from Mrs. Dalzell's residence on Ridge Avenue in Pittsburgh and brought to Carnegie Institute on February 19, 1929. It was accessioned on February 25, 1929.\n\nUnder review by CGK",
