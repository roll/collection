  "provenance_text": "Benton Murdoch Spruance [1904-1967], Philadelphia, PA, until 1947; possibly Frank K. M. Rehn, Inc., New York, NY, until February 1947 [1]; Mrs. James H. Beal (born Rebecca Huebley Jones) [1898-1993], Pittsburgh, PA, 1947 until April 11, 1957 [1]; gift to Department of Fine Arts, Carnegie Institute, Pittsburgh, PA, April 1957.\n\nNotes:\n[1]. Mrs. Beal purchased a Spruance lithograph with this title from the Rehn gallery for $24 in February 1947 (see curatorial file for copy of invoice from the Rehn archives at Archives of American Art.) She also purchased one from the artist in July 1947 for $24 (see curatorial file for list of lithographs purchased from the artist in July 1947.) The Beals lent one of these lithographs (no. 15) to \"Exhibition of Lithographs by Benton Spruance\" held at Department of Fine Arts, Carnegie Institute, May - June 1949. It was likely this one. Apparently, the lithographs in the exhibition remained on indefinite loan at Carnegie Institute (see letter to Mrs. Beal, dated January 18, 1955.) They were accessioned later, on April 11, 1957.",
