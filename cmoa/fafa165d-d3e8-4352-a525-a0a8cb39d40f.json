  "provenance_text": "William Henry Rinehart [1825-1874], Baltimore, MD and Rome, Italy; Maria Elizabeth Cleveland (Mrs. Augustus Cleveland) [1822-1897], New York, NY and Paris, France [1]. Possibly a member of the Scaife family, Pittsburgh, PA [2]. Eleanor Park Kelly [1897-1982], Pittsburgh, PA, until January 18, 1982 [3]; by descent to her nephew George Armstrong Kelly IV [c. 1932-1987], New York, NY; by gift to the Epiphany Association, Pittsburgh, PA, in 1982 until 1995 [4]; sale, Royal York Auction Gallery, Pittsburgh, PA, May 27, 1995, lot 813 [5]; purchased by Michael Malley Jr. [1939-2016], East End Galleries, Pittsburgh, PA [6]; Carnegie Museum of Art, Pittsburgh, PA, May 1995.\n\nNotes:\n[1]. \"Mr. A Cleaveland\" bought two reliefs from the sculptor in 1867 and commissioned a portrait of his wife, which was completed and paid for in May 1868 (see notes from Rinehart's account book in curatorial file.)\n[2]. After a few relatively minor bequests to her sister and two servants, Mrs. Cleveland's will gave all of her furniture, objects of bijouterie and virtu to William Lucien Scaife; his brother Marvin F. Scaife was, however, the major beneficiary, receiving \"a life income of substantially all her property...\" See copy of \"Matter of the Contested Will of Maria Elizabeth Cleveland, Deceased\" (reference information of court decision and copies of newspaper reports in curatorial file for 1997.55.)\n[3]. Miss Kelly's residence was located at 1145 Beechwood Boulevard, Pittsburgh PA. Before the estate sale, the sculpture was on the premises in its packing box with wadded up Washington DC newspapers, ca. 1910. The Kelly family apparently maintained close friendships with members of the Scaife family. \n[4]. Information from Epiphany Association website. \n[5]. Onsite sale at 1145 Beechwood Boulevard, titled \"Collection of the late Eleanor Park Kelly\" and, alternatively, \"Estate of Eleanor Park Kelly.\"\n[6]. Purchased on behalf of Carnegie Museum of Art.",
