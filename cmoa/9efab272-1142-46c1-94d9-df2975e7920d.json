  "provenance_text": "Gerald Leslie Brockhurst [1890-1978]. Charles J. Rosenbloom [1898-1973], Pittsburgh, PA (Lugt Suppl. 633b), likely by March 1938 until April 1, 1973 [1]; bequest to Museum of Art, Carnegie Institute, Pittsburgh, PA, February 1974.\n\nNotes:\n[1]. Mr. Rosenbloom lent the painting to the Brockhurst exhibition at the Department of Fine Arts, Carnegie Institute, in February 1940 (no. 12, \"Star Mantle,\" illustrated in the exhibition catalogue.) In correspondence with the museum's John O'Connor, dated March 25, 1938, Mr. Rosenbloom mentioned a Brockhurst painting in his collection from \"about 1923 or 1925\" without giving a title. It is almost definitely this work, because, though his collection included many works by this artist, it contained only three oils. One was a commissioned portrait of Mr. Rosenbloom from 1939 and the other a work from about 1915 (74.7.7)",
