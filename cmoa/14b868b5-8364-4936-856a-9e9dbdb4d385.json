  "provenance_text": "Cardinal Lucien Louis Joseph Napoleon Bonaparte [1803-1857], Rome, Italy; Collection of Cardinal Lucien Louis Joseph Napoleon Bonaparte; purchased by Mrs. William J. Latta, Philadelphia, PA [1]; Charles Bingham, her brother, Washington, DC. Ruel P. Tolman [1879-1954], Washington, DC; purchased by Herbert DuPuy [1856-1930], Pittsburgh, PA, May 13, 1918; gift to Department of Fine Arts, Carnegie Institute, Pittsburgh, PA, November 1927. \nNOTES: [1] Her birth name was Kitty Nigh Bingham. DuPuy's notes state that Latta purchased this item \"directly from the Prince Cardinal Bonpaparte's collection\" but is unclear of when this occured, and if that purchase was after Cardinal Bonaparte's death and therefore purchased from an estate, or if this item was purchased from the Cardinal while he was still alive.",
