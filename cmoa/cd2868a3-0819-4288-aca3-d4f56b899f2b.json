  "provenance_text": "Benton Murdoch Spruance [1904-1967], Philadelphia, PA, until November 1947; Mrs. James H. Beal (born Rebecca Huebley Jones) [1898-1993], Pittsburgh, PA, November 26, 1947 until April 11, 1957 [1]; gift to Department of Fine Arts, Carnegie Institute, Pittsburgh, PA, April 1957.\n\nNotes:\n[1]. Purchased from the artist (through Carnegie Institute) for $24 (see curatorial file for copy of correspondence with John O'Connor, dated November 26, 1947.) The Beals lent the lithograph (no. 14) to \"Exhibition of Lithographs by Benton Spruance\" held at Department of Fine Arts, Carnegie Institute, May - June 1949. Apparently, the lithographs in the exhibition remained on indefinite loan at Carnegie Institute (see letter to Mrs. Beal, dated January 18, 1955.) They were gifted and accessioned later, on April 11, 1957.",
