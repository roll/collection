  "provenance_text": "Adrien Ysenbrandt [1500?-1551?]. M. Nieuwenhuys, in 1856 [1]; purchased by Thomas Baring, M.P. [1799-1873], in 1856 [2]; bequest to his nephew, Thomas George Baring, Lord Northbrook, subsequently 1st Earl of Northbrook [1826-1904], in 1873 [3]; by descent to Francis George Baring, 2nd Earl of Northbrook [1850-1929], until at least 1927 [4]. Julius Böhler, Munich, Germany, August 30, 1929 until at least January 16, 1935, stock no. 217-29 [5]; Howard A. Noble [1874-1964], Pittsburgh, PA by April 1944 until April 30, 1964 [6]; his bequest to Museum of Art, Carnegie Institute, Pittsburgh, PA, May 1964. \n\nNOTES:\n[1]. The information is from entry no. 5 in the 1889 catalogue of the Earl of Northbrook collection. It refers, most likely, to noted collector and dealer C. J. Nieuwenhuys [1799-1883], Brussels and London. \n[2]. As by Bernard Van Orley. \n[3]. In the 1889 catalogue of the Earl of Northbrook collection, this work, no. 5, is simply listed under the \"Early Netherlandish School\" section, with the following footnote: \"A similar picture was, in 1860, in the collection of the Rev. Mr. Heath, Vicar of Enfield.\" \n[4]. The Earl lent it to the Royal Academy Exhibition of Flemish and Dutch art in 1927. \n[5]. Photo, no. R 770. Information from a copy of the firm's inventory records at the Getty Research Institute. The record for this painting lists the source as \"Sarasota N 248\", which may suggest a connection with John Ringling with whom the Böhler firm had a long and close relationship.\n[6]. Notes: In 1944, the painting hung in the living room of the Noble residence at 1245 Shady Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA.",
