Beal (born Rebecca Huebley Jones) [1898-1993], Pittsburgh, PA, January 1949 until April 11, 1957 [1]; gift to Department of Fine Arts, Carnegie Institute, Pittsburgh, PA, April 1957.\n\nNotes:\n[1]. Purchased for $24 (see entry no. 65 in Mrs. Beal's handwritten notes on Spruance lithographs.) The Beals lent the lithograph (no. 59) to \"Exhibition of Lithographs by Benton Spruance\" held at Department of Fine Arts, Carnegie Institute, May - June 1949. Apparently, the lithographs in the exhibition remained on indefinite loan at Carnegie Institute (see letter to Mrs. Beal, dated January 18, 1955.) They were gifted and accessioned later, on April 11, 1957.",
